# STM32F103-libraries
A collection of libraries for STM32F103 registers and peripherals - work in progress

**THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS**

It was tested with Atollic TrueStudio 9.3.0. It works with it.
Arduino IDE, Visual Code and other IDEs are not supported at the moment, they are in the backlog.
I'm open to comments and suggestions, but at the moment the project is suspended due to job responsibilities.

Examples are old, please manually replace the library names in #includes.
